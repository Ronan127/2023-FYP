\chapter{Resource use and end of life strategy}

This project built a prototype device that has a motor, a controller, wheels, and several custom parts such as gears and frames. A battery was not included as it is unnecessary for a prototype build which can otherwise be wired to a power supply.
The device benefits from having a low mass, so there was already an incentive to use materials sparingly. Before construction, the design was be simulated to ensure that it meets requirements; this mitigated the chance that a second prototype would need to be built. Upon completion of the project, the prototype can be disassembled and the motor, controller, and wheels can be reused in future projects. The custom parts are specific to this design so will not be suitable for most reuse applications; they shall be recycled. If the materials are such that they cannot be recycled, then they shall be disposed of instead. These materials are chemically inert (not hazardous).
