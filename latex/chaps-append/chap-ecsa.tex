		ECSA outcome& Application \\ 
		\hline
		Demonstrate competence to identify, assess, formulate and solve convergent and
		divergent engineering problems creatively and innovatively. & 
		The design aspect of this project will require creative solutions to overcome the limitations of previous designs. \\ 
		\hline
		Application of scientific and engineering knowledge: Demonstrate competence to apply knowledge
		of mathematics, basic science and engineering sciences from first principles to solve engineering problems. & 
		Producing the mathematical model will require kinematic calculations. \\ 
		\hline
		Engineering Design: Demonstrate competence to perform creative, procedural and non-procedural design and synthesis of components, systems, engineering works, products or processes.& A prototype of a USAR platform will be designed and produced. \\ 
		\hline
		Engineering methods, skills and tools, including Information Technology: Demonstrate competence
		to use appropriate engineering methods, skills and tools, including those based on information technology. & 
		The project involves a CAD drawing and simulation of the platform, which will be based on information technology.\\ 
		\hline
		Professional and technical communication: Demonstrate competence to communicate effectively,
		both orally and in writing, with engineering audiences and the community at large. & 
		All deliverables, including the proposal, progress report, final report, and presentation will demonstrate competent and effective communication. \\ 
		\hline
		Individual, Team and Multidisciplinary Working: Demonstrate competence to work effectively as an
		individual, in teams and in multi-disciplinary environments. & 
		This project is done individually, with some input from the project supervisor. \\ 
		\hline
		Independent Learning Ability: Demonstrate competence to engage in independent learning through
		well-developed learning skills. & 
		Research will be done in the literature review. \\
