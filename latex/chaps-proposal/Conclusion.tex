\chapter{Conclusions}
%In conclusion, sound localisation is a promising technology that could be used in more applications if it were more precise. The proposed project will design and build a sound localisation device, and investigate methods to improve its performance. The project activities have been outlined and planned, risks have been assessed, and an expected budget of R221725 is presented.
USAR robots are a promising technology for disaster response. Reducing the cost of these robots will make them more accessible. The proposed project will provide a model to describe the kinematics of USAR robots that use LIMs for locomotion to reduce costs, and will produce a prototype of a USAR robot platform to show that the model is accurate. The result of these activities will be a validated model that can be used to inform future USAR designs using LIMs.\\

\noindent The project activities have been outlined and the project risks have been assessed and mitigated. The expected duration of the project is 8 months and the expected budget is R265 400.
