\chapter{Risk Assessment}

The main risk to the feasibility of the project is that there will not be enough time to build a fully functioning robot platform. The projects preceding this one all encountered complications when building robot platforms that they were unable to solve within the time constraints of their projects. This risk will be mitigated by completing activities in a timely manner as described in the Gantt. Chart, as well as careful planning and consideration of previous pitfalls.
\\

\noindent There is also the risk that it will be impossible to create a closed form model to describe the dynamics of the system. If this is the case, simplifications and numerical methods will be used to produce the model.\\

\noindent There is a considerable risk that the project will exceed the allowed cost. This is because the prototype may require hardware such as high powered motors, custom parts, encoders, controllers, and possibly batteries, which may have a considerable cost. This will be mitigated by using hardware from the university where possible, as well as carefully considering the cost of components.\\
