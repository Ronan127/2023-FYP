\chapter{Resource use and end of life strategy}

This project will build a prototype device that has a motor, a controller, wheels, and several custom parts such as gears and frames. A battery is unlikely to be included as it may be too expensive for a prototype build which can otherwise be wired to a power supply.
The prototype will likely benefit from having a low mass, so there is already an incentive to use materials sparingly. Before construction, the design will be simulated to ensure that it meets requirements; this will mitigate the chance that a second prototype will need to be built. Upon completion of the project, the prototype will be disassembled and the motor, controller, and wheels can be reused in future projects. The custom parts are specific to this design so will not be suitable for most reuse applications; they shall be recycled. If the materials are such that they cannot be recycled, then they shall be disposed of instead. These materials will be chemically inert (not hazardous).
