\chapter{Design requirements}

The objective of the design phase is to design a LIMed platform that can be used to validate the mathematical model. The requirements for this design are documented in this section.

\section{Stakeholder requirements}

This project is done at the request of Justin Pead, who supervised previous LIM projects at UCT. For the purposes of this section, this project's supervisor, Mr. Wayne Swart, acts as an intermediary between the stakeholder and the designer.

\section{Engineering requirements}

In this section, the stakeholder requirements (SRs) are expressed as functional requirements (FRs) and performance requirements (PRs). FRs describe the actions that the system must perform, while PRs are measures of how well the system performs the functions.
