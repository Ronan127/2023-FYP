function [solution] = mysolver(equations)
%UNTITLED Solves a set of equations through a series of substitutions
%   Detailed explanation goes here
symbols = symvar(equations);
symnames = string(symbols);
solution = struct;
for i = 1:length(symnames)
    tempstruct = struct(symnames(i),[]);
    if i == 1
        solution = tempstruct;
    else
        solution = [solution, tempstruct];
    end
end

for i = 1:length(equations)
    vars = symvar
